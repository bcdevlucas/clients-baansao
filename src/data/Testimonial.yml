      Stephanie’s class was super relaxed and super fun. We learned new techniques and new products and were able to make 2 beautiful pieces to take home. I loved the instruction and the freedom with which we could pick our own colours and embellishments. I will definitely be back!

      Registered in the Inks, Resin, Crystals, Stones and Glitter Art Escape. Stephanie was a fabulous instructor. She was welcoming, patient and inspiring. I was very happy with my painting and the experience. Would absolutely take another Wilder Than the Wind Creations class!

      I recently took an art class here. It was ridiculously amazing. I had so much fun! I felt like a little kid creating my artwork. Stephanie is such an awesome teacher she teaches you many practical techniques but also gives you plenty of time to play around make a mess and encourages you to have fun. Stephanie’s energy is fabulous!
