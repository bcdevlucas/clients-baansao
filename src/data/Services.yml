      In this three hour art escape, we will paint a cross section of the ocean,
      as you would see it as it washes onto your feet. Your water will have
      dimension and colour, foam and movement. We will also paint an art tile to
      have some reference to alcohol inks. Your final piece will measure 9X12
      and cost is $95 for the three hour workshop. Your piece will have to be
      picked up at a later date, as it takes overnight to dry. 11X14 and larger
      paintings are available at an extra cost.

      In this art escape, we will be doing an intuitive painting of a birch
      treeline with a background on yupo paper mounted to a 9X12 birch panel. If
      we have time, we will also do some more intuitive fluid painting on tiles.
      You will receive lots of instruction, but will choose your own colours and
      any changes you desire. $85 per person, including materials. No experience
      necessary. This is an amazing class to get the most out of the alcohol
      inks themselves. Your painting skills will be well on their way with ONE
      three hour class.
