      Escape into the world of glassy resin, crystals and semi precious
      stones such as Jasper, Turquoise, hematite, quartz, and more. In
      this three hour art escape, we will learn how to create a vivid
      abstract alcohol ink painting on a birch panel, with glitter, semi
      precious stones and crystals adding to the effects. We will learn
      how to use resin on paintings, however your piece will have to be
      picked up the next day or later (12 hour cure time). Experience is
      not necessary, and all materials plus many choices of crystals
      will be provided, and a handout will be emailed to you so you can
      replicate the techniques we practiced. $95 per person. Centrally
      located in Edmonton! Please message this account to register for
      the art escape.

      In this three hour art escape, we will paint a cross section of
      the ocean. Your water will have dimension and colour, foam and
      movement. We will also paint an art tile to have some reference to
      alcohol inks. Depending on your choice, the painting will measure
      12X16 and the serving board will be 9X12. Cost for the three hour
      workshop is $85 for the cutting board and $95 for the ocean art..
      Your piece will have to be picked up at a later date, as it takes
      overnight to dry. These classes fill up quickly due to the small
      class size required. Please message on facebook to sign up.
