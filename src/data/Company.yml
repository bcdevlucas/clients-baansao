      A trip to Florence in 2016 inspired the start of a full time art career for Stephanie Lane â€“ the founder of Wilder Than The Wind Creations.
      She specializes in alcohol ink paintings and resin art, and teaches what she knows to others. She also does mixed media work with acrylics. Wilder than the Wind is proud to have its studio in Little Italy, in the heart of Edmonton.
