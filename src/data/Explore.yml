      Saowaneeâ€™s place is located in Ko Samui, Chang Wat Surat Thani, Thailand.
      Baan Saowanee Bamboo Gardens cottages are tucked away in a quiet, green space ( you will hear birds singing ), but just a short 5 minute walk to local restaurants and shops. Venture another 5 minute walk down Soi 1 and you'll reach the Island main road ( taxis, shops, bars, restaurants ). From the main road another ten minute walk and you'll arrive at Mae Nam Beach. Of course, if you rent a motorbike or car, driving distance to the beach is only 5 minutes.
