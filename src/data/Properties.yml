      + 3 ensuite bedrooms: private terraces, main floor bedrooms have direct access to the pool

      + Quiet location, but only a 5 minute drive to the beach.


      **The space**


      Baan Saowanee Orchard View Pool Villa is located in a very quiet community enhanced by lush tropical greenery, fruit trees and flower blooms. Privacy is a featured quality: the 800 square meter grounds are landscaped,walled and feature a 4m X 9m saltwater pool.
