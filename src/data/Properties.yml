  Baan Saowanee is a collection of holiday home rentals situated on the north side of Ko Samui island, a short five minute drive to scenic Mae Nam Beach. Sun, sand and the Gulf of Siam combine to make many a perfect day.
  Our vacation homes are located in a quiet community enhanced with lush tropical greenery, fruit trees and flower blooms; but only a short walk away from convenience: restaurants, coffee bars, bakeries and other small shops. Picturesque Mae Nam village is nearby, as is the community Buddhist spiritual centre: Golden Mountain Temple.
  Baan Saowanee guests have a range of rental options to choose from, dependent upon the number of persons and quality of accommodation. All of our holiday properties are clean, attractive and well maintained.
