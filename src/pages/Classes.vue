            <p class="text-muted">Escape into the world of glassy resin, crystals and semi precious stones such as Jasper, Turquoise, hematite, quartz, and more. In this three hour art escape, we will learn how to create a vivid abstract alcohol ink painting on a birch panel, with glitter, semi precious stones and crystals adding to the effects. We will learn how to use resin on paintings, however your piece will have to be picked up the next day or later (12 hour cure time). Experience is not necessary, and all materials plus many choices of crystals will be provided, and a handout will be emailed to you so you can replicate the techniques we practiced. $95 per person. Centrally located in Edmonton! Please message this account to register for the art escape.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">In this three hour art escape, we will paint a cross section of the ocean. Your water will have dimension and colour, foam and movement. We will also paint an art tile to have some reference to alcohol inks. Depending on your choice, the painting will measure 12X16 and the serving board will be 9X12. Cost for the three hour workshop is $85 for the cutting board and $95 for the ocean art.. Your piece will have to be picked up at a later date, as it takes overnight to dry. These classes fill up quickly due to the small class size required. Please message on facebook to sign up. Centrally located in Edmonton!</p>
