If you're curious about seeing a buffalo fight the next time you visit Koh Samui, the surest bet is to plan your trip around either New Year's Day or Songkran, the Thai New Year. This will, of course, result in higher prices on the hotel where make your Koh Samui home, but if you want to be certain you catch a buffalo fight, you'll have to deal with the extra expenditure.

With this being said, Buffalo fights do happen throughout the year, in designated stadiums all around the island. Due to both the sacred nature of the fights, and the fact that they aren't yet a huge tourist draw, the stadiums don't tend to exist in areas Westerners frequent, so your best bet for finding one is to befriend a local (hint: your hotel's receptionist is a great start for this) and ask if he knows when the next fight will occur. If you're lucky, he might even be a fan and invite you to come along with him and his friends!
