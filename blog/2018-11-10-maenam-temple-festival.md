Like in the rest of Thailand, Buddhism is the religion followed by the majority (over 90% of people are Buddhist), followed by Islam, Taoism, and Christianity. Paradoxically, the first ever settlers on the island were Chinese traders and Muslim fishermen. Koh Samui is home to many old Buddhist temples and Chinese shrines, including two impressive religious landmarks: Samui Big Buddha - a massive 15-metre seated Buddha overlooking the sea on the northeastern coast and, in the same area, Wat Plai Laem, a superb temple featuring a striking white 18-arm statue of Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy and Compassion. See below the most notable temples and shrines to be visited in Koh Samui.
