In the past, before Samui's tourism boom, coconuts used to represent the main industry here. In the Southern Thailand provinces, monkeys work for humans in the harvesting of coconuts. Being expert climbers and having quick skills, the monkeys are great helping hands of a farmer.

Samui Monkey shows are very unique and can be enjoyed at the open-air theater. A descendant of Samui monkeys trained for working in coconut orchards and collecting the fruits. At the Samui Monkey Theater, each monkey must go to a monkey training school where they are taught coconut-picking skills and ways to communicate with humans. The monkeys also learn how to work with safety. The monkey shows will well make you laugh and you will have a good time there.
