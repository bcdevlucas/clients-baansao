  ### The space


  Baan Saowanee Orchard View Pool Villa is located in a very quiet community enhanced by lush tropical greenery, fruit trees and flower blooms. Privacy is a featured quality: the 800 square meter grounds are landscaped, walled and feature a 4m X 9m saltwater pool.


  The house (200 square meters) is both airy and spacious, its charm enhanced by hardwood floors and Thai contemporary furnishings. The two main floor bedrooms slide open to terraces providing pool and garden views. The upper floor bedroom terrace overlooks an adjacent eucalyptus plantation.


  ### Guest access


  Orchard View Villa is neither a condo, nor a unit in a resort complex. It's a spacious and comfortable, quiet and private villa; yet it's located only a few minutes drive to the beach or the island ring road.


  ### Interaction with guests


  Your host, Saowanee, resides in the same community and will be pleased to assist in making your Ko Samui holiday a special experience.


  ### Other things to note


  We can assist in making arrangements for car and motorbike rentals, tours to island attractions, and provide information regarding active relaxation choices (yoga, tennis, dancing, etc.).
